          <p>
            Margaret and Hannah, two sisters, founded Lavie Juice and Smoothies
            in 2011. The sisters had fun making juice for their friends. They
            eventually decided to turn it into a business and began taking
            orders for their friends' parties and events. The sisters were so
            professional that their friends began referring them to other
            customers, and Lavie quickly became a household name for
            high-quality juice and smoothies. They now produce large quantities
            of juice for event planners and organizers, and they are known for
            prompt delivery and friendly customer service.
