            Hi thereüëã! We are Margaret and Hannah, the dynamic duo behind Lavie
            Juice and Smoothies. We started this amazing journey back in 2011.
            <br />
            <br />
            We've always loved whipping up delicious juices for our friends, and
            it wasn't long before we realized we could turn our passion into a
            business. From small gatherings to big bashes, we started taking
            orders for our refreshing creations at our friends' parties and
            events.
            <br />
            <br />
            And guess what? Our juices were such a hit that our friends couldn't
            stop talking about themüòÇ! Before we knew it, we were getting
            referrals left and right, and Lavie became synonymous with top-notch
            juice and smoothiesüçπ.
            <br />
            <br />
            Fast forward to today, and we're still doing what we love, but on a
            much bigger scale. We're now the go-to juice supplier for event
            planners and organizers, delivering large quantities of our tasty
            concoctions with a smile. Our secret? Prompt delivery and a
            dedication to providing the friendliest customer service around.
            Join us on our journey and let Lavie Juice and Smoothies add a
            splash of flavor to your next event!
